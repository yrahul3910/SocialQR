#  Contribution Guidelines

## How do I contribute?

Please follow the standard Git flow: fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Please also comment on the issue that you are trying to fix, to prevent duplicate effort.

## What do the issue labels mean?

For now, there are the following labels assigned to issues:

* `up next`: This is the next issue that will be worked on.
* `up second`: The second issue that will be worked on.

The motive behind these is that sometimes, one commit will resolve two issues, so a clear order is essential for smooth development.

## What style guidelines should I follow?

There is no rigorous style guide; however, it is recommended that you follow XCode's default settings. In later stages of this project, a definitive style guideline will be established.

However, it is expected that you comment your code to improve readability.
